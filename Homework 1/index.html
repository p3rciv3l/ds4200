    Hello! My name is Avinsh Krishna. I am a third-year student studying computer science and finance. I have held a lot of roles in finance, such as roles in 
    investment banking and private equity. I also have made a small trading bot a few years ago that called the Coinbase and Google API to invest money at a
    specified period of time. Hoping to learn more about design and learn good front end skills!

    <p>
